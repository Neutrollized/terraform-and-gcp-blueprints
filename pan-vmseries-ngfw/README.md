A Terraform template that deploys an HTTP ELB, multiple VM-Series firewalls, multiple Apache web servers, a TCP ILB and associated subnets (as in the image shown below). In addition, the Terraform template can be used in conjunction with bootstrapping to automate additional VM-Series firewall to configuration parameters such as routes, security policies, etc.

### Support Policy

The code and templates in the repo are released under an as-is, best effort, support policy. These scripts should viewed as community supported and Palo Alto Networks will contribute our expertise as and when possible. We do not provide technical support or help in using or troubleshooting the components of the project through our normal support options such as Palo Alto Networks support teams, or ASC (Authorized Support Centers) partners and backline support options. The underlying product used (the VM-Series firewall) by the scripts or templates are still supported, but the support is only for the product functionality and not for help in deploying or using the template or script itself. Unless explicitly tagged, all projects or work posted in our GitHub repository (at https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks) or sites other than our official Downloads page on https://support.paloaltonetworks.com are provided under the best effort policy.
